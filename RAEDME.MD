# Turtle Racing Game

This simple Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to create a racing game where turtles compete against each other. Each turtle is assigned a random color, and they race towards the top of the screen. The first turtle to reach or surpass the top boundary is declared the winner.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kilundi/turtle-racing-game.git
```

2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd turtle-racing-game
```

### Usage

Run the Python script to start the game:

```bash
python turtle_race.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of turtles (between 2 and 10) that will participate in the race.

## Features

- User input for the number of turtles participating in the race.
- Random assignment of colors to turtles.
- Turtles move forward randomly each round.
- The winning turtle is determined when it crosses or reaches the top boundary.

## How to Play

1. Enter the desired number of turtles when prompted (between 2 and 10).
2. Watch the turtles race towards the top of the screen.
3. The winner is announced when a turtle crosses or reaches the top boundary.

## Example

```bash
Enter the number of turtles (2 - 10): 5
The winner is the turtle with color: green
```

The game output will display the color of the winning turtle.
